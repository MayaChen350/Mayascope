Wandering under the shadow of the sun
Lost, forgotten and abandoned
In the mirror I see no reflection
The steps of my efforts erased
No one could tell they have ever been there
The desert leaves no traces
My two feet in cold water
I wonder what I should look at
But anyway I’m getting deep underwater
///
I regret so much
I hate everything
I want to get rid of everything
I want to pass time with everyone
Life or death will never do the job
I’m prisoner of my own pain
Life is just a desert with a water source just getting further and further
At the end the desert drains you and you get mad
///
I’m floating in the void between boredom and numbness
Everything is just cold… And ice
What am I supposed to find here?
The path is unclear…
Nothing’s clear anymore
Before everything froze
I was waving on the seas of life
None knows where those waves will lead them
Only can you be pleased by the lights of the sun
Or can you be feared by the shines of the moon
Unless everything freeze, that is
///
Burn in a pillar of flames
The flames of your indecision
The flames of your lies
The flames of your unsaid and undone
And since you are blazed
Can you see them anymore?
Your true feelings?
///
Do you think I’m dancing?
What do you think I’m doing?
From here you should be seeing
That I’m not doing what you’re doing
When you are skating
I find myself falling
But look at me! I’m fine!
I wonder sometimes
If sometimes I should place things at their « right » places
Instead of living in dust
But things are perfectly placed… Where they shouldn’t be placed
Then does that makes them their « right » places?
If yes that would make me lost
I’m walking outside the same way, same route, same directions, same time
Go there, go where? Not there, go where?
Do what? Do this, do that
Do those things because the other guy in front of you did the same thing
No!
I don’t want to!
What if I say no?
No I have to so
I won’t miss the next bateau
But why is it that way?
Anyway I shouldn’t care
As I can’t change this anyway
I’m so happy that through my tower
I can see all those lovers
For who they get all the luck
But so should I be happy
As I’m still very lucky :
To be alive is a stroke of luck!
I passed through a lot already
I say that pain is my bestie
As we know eachother too much
And we hate eachother so much
There are walls everywhere
They’re watching me from everywhere
But for me I feel that I’m the middle of nowhere
Just how many impossibilities will I have to achieve?
So I could get what I cannot acquire?
///
Isolated on the unsupportable
I’m waving my hand at the wind
The cold wind of my grind
Able to do something
But in the end have done nothing
But I can’t do anything else than keep on smiling
///
Things used to go forward
Faster, and faster
And then slower, and slower
Things cannot go backward
And slower, slower
It’s hard to notice there was a day anymore
And slower, slower (2x)
Light, is there no more?
Freeze
No more things
I’m no more advancing
Hello? Can anyone hear me?
Has everyone forgotten about me?
Already?
Dark, yet darker
I walk, or do I?
Scarier, yet scarier
I’m crying, am I?
The silence
The total darkness
The feeling of being watched
Even if there is no one else
I failed
I did failed
I think I did failed?
I want to feel again
I AM BLEEDING FROM THE INSIDE
I don’t think I can say : « not again »
I AM BURNING FROM EVERY SIDES
Why…?
Why why?
Why why?!
WHY WHY?!
Everything I’ve seen
Everything I’ve done
Everything I’ve sacrificed
For finally sacrificing myself
For all I have undone
At the non-asking of the void
My final destination
///
Why are you even opening the lights?
That’s not how I feel
Don’t try to look at me
I have nothing for you
You can’t see me
You’re hiding me from you
You are alone
Do you see someone else in the dark?
///
If you have something you can enjoy
While I can’t even find the time to lend joy,
My tears covering the ground
Then why are you walking between my wounds?
You thought I would be warm but I am everything but warm
You left me
J’ai laissé ma vie
I hurt you
Mais tu étais déjà finie de nous
Life isn’t what it used to be
You can look at far at you can
Run as far as you can
It will have still be
And we will not
Be the same again
And it will not
Be summer again
For us
As snow is falling to cover us
At the beginning of Spring
///
Facing the ground, screaming
In my hands the same knife everyone was pointing me with
We hate you
Why don't you get away?
If I stand up no one's gonna look at me
My ridiculous face
My ridiculous body
My ridiculous mind
As I can't even stand up I'm just someone to laugh at
If some voices are calling for me, I can't hear them
If they knew I would just scare them
The knife draining my life would then be lend to them
I'm just a nuisance
Someone to complain about
As nobody understands me they'll prefer to scream at me
But I'm not someone to scream about
I wish they would just kill me
But my words are just words
And my texts are just meaningless
As all I do is pointless, useless
The knife passing through my life
I'm trying to find a way for it to be painless
So as I'm listening to the voices in my head
I try to disappear for that I can accept my pain
Don't think
Stop thinking
Nothing's gonna be fine
You're not worth thinking
Just sink
But don't drown
///
The sky is gray and I don't know if the stars stares at me
I will cry when they'll say that their lights are on me
In my head a fog
In my body no energy
I want to reach my hands to the stars that are long lost
Just please shine for me please
I had enough I'm not so tough
Enlight me with your light, enlight me with your life
I don't want to believe I'm hurt anymore
Even if I don't feel you around
I know that far ahead I matter more
And then I'll stop doing rounds
///
Nobody will see you
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
Nobody will care
Whatever you feel
Whatever you felt
Will I do it
Will I give up
What's on the road?
I don't know
Still a long way to go
I can't see it
I can hardly see it
The bliss, the joy, the happiness of my world
The curse of this world, with no one around
Hope
Is there any?
For me?
Someone like me
can deserves any?
I fall I advance
I trip I stand up
I fall
I sink...
I drown...
///
If only you knew
Than in another world, in another reality
I would have burn my hands for you
But now my hands are far
Far from reach, far, far
Who should hold unto them?
///
It's the end
It still amazes me that at the beginning
We were friends
But you threw me away
Why? Was I really that bad?
This is just so sad
The painful memories of a beautiful past
Haunting me, from how much I crashed
Trying so hard to stay on my raft
Your face won't go off my mind
You'll always be in my mind
No matter how hard you try me to not be in yours
I'll always remember you
No matter how far l'll have to look back
I'll always do
///
The deep plains of dread darken my head
The painful memories of living
As empty as I can be seeing
The uncomfortable feeling of comfort
The silence scolding me inside
A strange feeling of
Remove me my mask
Drown me into uncomfort
Give me what I lack
Take my soul away
Put your hand deep within
And take my light away
I can't think, feel or see
I can't bleed, fight or flee
Put me to sleep for my eternity
///
I can only see fire
The darkness flashes in my eyes
And the lightness darken into lies
When I'm not about to burst
I descend into madness
When I ascend the anger
Too pissed off to calm down
Too pissed off to break down
Too pissed off to know when to stop
In my head, in my hands, in my eyes I see fire
The fire burns
The fire will burn
///
Truth! You're a monster
Why don't you get away from me?
You scare me
And you scare the others
Why are you so ugly to my eyes
From far away you frighten me
When close I close my eyes
Only sometimes can you be pretty?
Stop touching my friends
Stop touching my future
Please, lemme stop seeing you
Others call you anxiety, but I prefer when I don't have to call you true
Lemme dive into the water
Stop watching me from there
I won't drown if you're not there
Just let me test the water
Only once
///
Stuck into hell
The voices are calling me
The words are hurting me
A terrible feeling
Unhappy living
A sheet to my death
An entrance to my despair
The cage is getting flooded
And by then in pain I would
My eyes have become black
And I lack the will to live
///
,>,[<->-]<>>+++[<++++>-]<[<++++>-]<.
///
It is cold tonight
Leaves, fall
Wind, blows
They leave
They leave you
///
From so far I knew it
I was looking at it
This shadow, as it drew closer to me
It'll push me in sorrow, like it has to be
I may have shined for others
But I won't shine for another
I take a hand to touch the ground
But there's nowhere good to take a step
I grab the barreaux of my prison bare handed
Aren't they still soft in my hands?
I desired love, I desired friends
But I wanted peace, I wanted peace
Rain can fall for the loss of others
Clouds can get out for the peace of oneself
///
I stole happiness from its locker
For once can I enjoy myself be selfish
Feelings stolen from my heart, I wished
They'll come back to me someday
Is it stealing to steal the steal of my feelings
The ones I've been wishing
They'll come back to me one day
But the knives are pointing from everywhere
They'll want them back from where they were
They never belonged to me anyway
///
A child who we did not love
Seeks love everywhere
When it's cold a hand will reach for them
A warm, soft hand will heal them
But when this hand is cold
Trying, the child will reach it
Their cold, trembling hand will approach it
And the child will realize
That they cannot help but be helped
A silent and uncomfortable feeling
The warm hand, getting colder
Leaving the child behind
The hand could not be helped
///
The voices are loud
They're tracking me
Piercing me
I can't move
Not a single step
I can't step out of the traps
The voices are loud
I'm doubting myself
I'm piercing myself
Can't leave them behind
Can't leave me behind
The voices
Whenever
Wherever
I can't go
Nowhere to go
I have no legs
///
Vision goes dark
Everything becomes black
The oceans becomes ice
The nature die around me
I can't see my hands
I can't feel my friends
I can't believe anymore
A frozen ship
How did it even happen
However it looks so normal to my eyes
The iceberg will never melt
The sun will never be hot enough
I'll be alone
Frozen
Again
And again
///
I let the water flow for a loved one
But the water was cold
Very cold
And now my friend is frozen
It doesn't matter if I tried to do any good
The seasons have lasted
And now alone
I dive my feet in the water
To join the frozen one
It's so lonely there,
With me around
///
Look everywhere around, so blurry
I listen to the sound, in silence
The feelings, so empty
They are talking, in silence
My eyes, so shiny
I'm screaming, in silence
///
Did you ever see a microwave?
No way you have never seen one
Electromagnetic waves?
I don't know if I've seen that
Electromagnetic microwaves?
Where am I even going with that
But anyway you can't see it
But the people who made them can see it
The C language!
Now I hope you see it
That it was made into it
Into the C language
(Probably)
